Problem:
You have 3 tasks (A, B, C) to be completed by 2 resources (X, Y) within 3 time slots. 
Each task requires a certain amount of time on each resource, and each resource can work on only one task at a time.

Let's think step by step

Decision Variables:
* T_ij : Binary variable representing whether task i is assigned to resource j (1 if assigned, 0 otherwise).

Domains:
* T_ij = {0,1} where 0 represents that the task i is not assigned to resource j and 1 represents that the task i is assigned to resource j

Constraints:
1) Task Assignment Constraint: Each task should be assigned to exactly one resource.
∑_(j=1) ( T_ij = 1 ), for each task i
2) Resource Availability Constraint: At any time slot, a resource can handle only one task.
∑_(i=1) ( T_ij <= 1 ), for each resource j
3) Time Slot Constraint: Each task should be completed within the given time frame (3 time slots).
∑_(i=1)∑_(j=1) ( T_ij <= 3 )

Reasoning:
* Task Assignment Constraint: Ensures that each task is assigned to exactly one resource, preventing over-assignment or under-assignment.
* Resource Availability Constraint: Ensures that each resource can handle only one task at a time, preventing resource conflicts.
* Time Slot Constraint: Limits the total number of tasks assigned within the given time frame.
